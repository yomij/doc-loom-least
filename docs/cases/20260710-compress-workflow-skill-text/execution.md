# Execution Report

## Plan Reference

- plan_version: 1
- base_commit: `1d5a05b2e3a49637876447c520a917e6e80dd31e`
- adaptive_execution: no

## Plan Followed

Yes. This is a behavior-preserving text refactor under the approved seven-file
scope.

## Characterization Baseline

| File | Lines | Words |
|---|---:|---:|
| `review/SKILL.md` | 322 | 1,795 |
| `tdd-execute/SKILL.md` | 308 | 2,010 |
| `doc-sync-close/SKILL.md` | 190 | 1,238 |
| `plan-confirm/SKILL.md` | 187 | 1,181 |
| `shared-protocol.md` | 344 | 2,183 |
| `development-flow.md` | 175 | 1,064 |
| `git.md` | 84 | 383 |
| **Total** | **1,610** | **9,854** |

Semantic locks:

- Authority retains mandatory eligible Post-execution review, semantic
  completion commits, scoped plan authorization, and closure-commit-gated
  `Done`.
- Git authority retains title types, trailer syntax, atomicity, clean closure,
  and rewritten-history evidence invalidation.
- Shared protocol retains ownership, exact state derivation, artifact policy,
  authorization exclusions, Atomic Commit Contract, degraded Git, Fast-Path,
  and legacy compatibility.
- Stage Skills retain their approved triggers, owner responsibilities, gates,
  evidence, and review/commit/closure transitions.

## Changes Made

- Approved plan committed as `3f65c73`.
- Authority compression committed as `33f6692` and verified.
- Shared protocol compressed from 344 lines / 2,183 words to 285 lines /
  1,689 words while retaining all shared contracts.

## TDD Applicability

- TDD Required: No.
- Exception: Pure documentation change; behavior-preserving refactor.
- Verification: characterization anchors, before/after counts, Skill validation,
  YAML/frontmatter, links, symlinks, diff/Git checks, and final dual-axis review.

## Acceptance Criteria Status

| Criteria | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Plan commit | met | `3f65c73d9da545d247c46059121445bfdc9a82c6` |
| Authority compression | met | `development-flow.md` 175→80 lines; `git.md` 84→61 lines; required principles retained |
| Shared compression | met | `shared-protocol.md` 344→285 lines and 2,183→1,689 words; semantic anchors and consumer links retained |
| Skill compression | pending | Task 3 |
| Final review | pending | Task 4 |
| Closure commit | pending | Task 5 |

## Commands Run

| Command | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Baseline `wc -l -w` | pass | 1,610 lines / 9,854 words |
| Authority semantic-anchor `rg` | pass | Required pre-compression facts located |
| Plan YAML/frontmatter and staged diff checks | pass | Plan commit created with declared trailers |
| Authority post-compression `wc -l -w` | pass | 141 lines / 633 words total, down from 259 / 1,447 |
| Authority principle/trailer semantic `rg` | pass | Stage ownership pointer, four workflow outcomes, title/trailers, closure and rewrite evidence retained |
| Authority `git diff --check` | pass | No whitespace errors |
| Shared post-compression `wc -l -w` | pass | 285 lines / 1,689 words, down from 344 / 2,183 |
| Shared positive/negative semantic `rg` | pass | Ownership, state derivation, artifacts, closure, routing, authorization, atomic, legacy, degraded Git, and Fast-Path anchors retained; stale wording absent |
| Shared consumer symlink/read checks | pass | All seven existing shared-protocol consumer links resolve to the owner file |
| Shared `git diff --check` | pass | No whitespace errors |

## Review Risk

High: compression touches active workflow authority and executable Skill
contracts. Final Engineering/Spec review must prove that no gate was weakened.

## Checkpoints / Commits

| Step | Commit | Verification |
|---|---|---|
| plan | `3f65c73d9da545d247c46059121445bfdc9a82c6` | YAML/frontmatter, staged scope, diff, trailers |
| authority-contracts | `33f6692836ebe0a23eedb53948eb4f92096870fc` | Principle anchors, counts, diff, trailers |
